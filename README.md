# VDA_FMA
Project was initiated at Volga Dnepr group at February 2019 to assist flight controllers and releive them of tracking every single change of aircraft status during arrival/loading/offloading/departure. 
The plan was to create web app to be distributed to agents at stations of ABC/Atran/VDA/Ruslan Salis.
Agent/crew were supposed to fill in corresponding fields upon finishing any operation to aircraft and entered data was supposed to be entered in centrallized flight control system automatically.
I created mockups in Figma with initial requirements to app.
We requested approximate prices / timeframe for development from several outsource agencies.
Project was not approved by top management for further development.
